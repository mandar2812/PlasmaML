The project depends on the [DynaML](https://github.com/mandar2812/DynaML) scala machine learning library and uses model and optimization implementations in it as a starting point for extensive experiments in space physics simulations and space weather prediction.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n*PlasmaML* is managed using the Simple Build Tool (sbt).\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n**Requirements**\r\n\r\n1. [Scala](scala-lang.org)\r\n2. [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)\r\n3. [R](https://www.r-project.org/)\r\n\r\n**Steps**\r\n\r\nAfter installing all the pre-requisites,\r\n\r\n1. Clone this project\r\n2. From the root directory type ```sbt```, you should see the sbt prompt.\r\n4. At the sbt prompt, choose appropriate sub-project ```project omni```\r\n5. Compile the sources ```compile```\r\n6. Run the scala console ```console```\r\n",
