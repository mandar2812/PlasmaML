# HELIOS

The `helios` module of the `PlasmaML` repository contains utilities for 
training tensorflow based models on solar data sets.

This repo is also the home of the reference implementation of the [_Dynamic Time Lag Regression_](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkxybANtDB) framework and its application on the solar wind prediction task.
